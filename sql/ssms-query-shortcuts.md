# SSMS Query Shortcuts

I recently came across Query Shortcuts in SSMS, which are keyboard shortcuts that will run pre-defined queries.

They've probably been around forever, but after discovering, using, and then losing my SSMS profile I couldn't remember where to go to set them up.

So, the menu location is:

**Tools -> Options -> Keyboard -> Query Shortcuts**

I use these for something as simple as a `USE <database>` statement to switch to a frequently used database.
