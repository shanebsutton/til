## About

I stumbled across [jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) and thought it would be a great way to organize my scattered notes, code snippets, and tips and tricks that I've collected in various places.

This will primarily be a place for me to maintain notes for myself, but it will also be a way for me to share with anyone who cares to take a look.

I will continue to migrate existing notes, as well as add anything new that I acquire along the way.
